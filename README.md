 ### Sales Estimation Algorithm


 #### Linear Regression
 
 Linear Regression is a machine learning algorithm based on supervised learning. Regression models a target prediction value based on independent variables. It is used for finding out the relationship between variables and forecasting. Different regression models differ based on â€“ the type of relationship between dependent and independent variables , and the number of independent variables used.

 This algorithm will be used to estimate sales using features and prices of the car at the make-model level.
