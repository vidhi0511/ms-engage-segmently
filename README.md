# Segmently -  Better way to understand your customer segments!

## Microsoft Engage 2022 | Data Analysis

## The Challenge 

Develop an application to demonstrate how the Automotive Industry could harness data to make informed decisions.
Demonstrate the use of data analytics in identifying:
- Customer segments
- Most popular car specification combination (engine type, fuel, mileage , etc.)
- Right time to launch a new car, etc.

## User Problem Understanding üë©‚Äçüíª

The user is an automotive OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer). He wants to gain an understanding of the following pain points:
- Which new car to position in the market for the target audience and what should be the expected sales?
    - Should a car be positioned in a Mid SUV range and at what price?
- What updates to launch in the existing car models at a variant level or as a revamp? For example:
    - Tata Harrier would like to check whether adding a petrol variant will increase the sales
    - Hyundai Santro would like to check if they should revamp or upgrade features at variant





## Agile Development Methodology üéØ
- I have divided the program into three weekly sprints with one epic for each sprint
- For the first sprint, the epic is to create a working data science pipeline to meet the requirements of the user problem
- For the second sprint, the epic is to create a working dashboard which will give access to the OEMs to access the dashboard & make queries
- For the third sprint, the epic is to create a dockerized container with the database which can host end to end solution



## Instructions to run the model: 

-  Main Requirement is Angular CLI. The Angular CLI is a command-line interface tool that is used to initialize, develop, scaffold, and maintain Angular applications directly from a command shell.

    - ### Step 1: Clone this Repository
        - ```git clone https://github.com/vidhi0511/ms-engage-segmently```

        
  
    - ### Step 2: Installation

        - #### Install nodejs

            For Linux and macOS

            ```sudo apt install nodejs```

            ```sudo apt install npm```
         
            ```node -v```

            For Windows

            - Go to https://nodejs.org/en/download/


        - #### Install AngularCLI
            ```npm install -g @angular/cli```

             ```ng --version```
        
        - #### Install Pandas
            ```pip install pandas```

    - ### Step 3: Move to the directory
         ```cd <path_of_the_directory>```

    - ### Step 4: Run the server
         ```ng serve```
